# Final-Project

This project seeks to show my learned skills on being able to mutate project data into a clean, usable format. Hopefully running the "run_analysis.R" 

The data can be found using this link: 

The R script "run_analysis.R" should be able to: 

1.) Extract the necessary data from the UCI website 
2.) Comb through said data and provide a.) a Mean and Standard Deviation b.) 
3.) export a clean "Final Data" file. 

The CodeBook should provide you with: 
1.) An explanation of the project 
2.) An enumerated list of all of the variables the Dataset includes 
3.) Copyright
